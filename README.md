# megahackv7-extension
A simple MegaHack v7 extension template in Rust/C++.

## How to use.
It is pretty straightforward, but you requie knowledge in both C++ and Rust. To create a GUI you have to edit library.cpp and use the hackpro.lib functions to create elements.
The pro of the GUI being in C++ is that Absolute can actually provide support for it - if you are having trouble understanding it - and there is example code in his repository.

If you have any questions DM me ig, my discord is `alpha ary#0001`.

**Feel free to give me suggestions!**
